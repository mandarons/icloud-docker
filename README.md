iCloud-docker (previously known as iCloud-drive-docker) is a simple iCloud client in Docker environment. It uses [iCloudPy](https://github.com/mandarons/icloudpy) python library to interact with iCloud server.

Primary use case of iCloud-docker is to periodically sync wanted or all of your iCloud drive, photos using your iCloud username and password. 

***Please note that this application only downloads the files from server. It does not upload the local files to the server (yet).***

  # Destination to store iCloud drive data locally
  destination: drive
  # Whether to remove local files that are not present on server
  remove_obsolete: false
