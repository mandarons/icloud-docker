iCloud-docker (previously known as iCloud-drive-docker) is a simple iCloud client in Docker environment. It uses [iCloudPy](https://github.com/mandarons/icloudpy) python library to interact with iCloud server.

Primary use case of iCloud-docker is to periodically sync wanted or all of your iCloud drive, photos using your iCloud username and password.

**_Please note that this application only downloads the files from server. It does not upload the local files to the server (yet)._**

## Installation

### Installation using Docker Hub

```
docker run --name icloud -v ${PWD}/icloud:/icloud -v ${PWD}/config:/config -e ENV_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/config/config.yaml mandarons/icloud-drive
```

### Installation using docker-compose

```yaml
services:
  icloud:
    image: mandarons/icloud-drive
    environment:
      - PUID=<insert the output of `id -u $user`>
      - PGID=<insert the output of `id -g $user`>
    env_file:
      - .env.icloud # Must contain ENV_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/config/config.yaml and optionally, ENV_ICLOUD_PASSWORD=<password>
    container_name: icloud
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ${PWD}/icloud:/icloud
      - ${PWD}/config:/config # Must contain config.yaml
      - ${PWD}/keyring:/home/abc/.local # Optional: Persist keyring for credentials (no password re-entry on container recreation)
```

### Authentication (required after container creation or authentication expiration)

```
# Login manually if ENV_ICLOUD_PASSWORD is not specified and/or 2FA is required
docker exec -it icloud /bin/sh -c "su-exec abc icloud --username=<icloud-username> --session-directory=/config/session_data"
```

For China server users, please add `--region=china` as follows:

```
# Login manually if ENV_ICLOUD_PASSWORD is not specified and/or 2FA is required
docker exec -it icloud /bin/sh -c "su-exec abc icloud --username=<icloud-username> --region=china --session-directory=/config/session_data"
```

Follow the steps to authenticate.

  filters: # Optional - use it only if you want to download specific folders.
    # File filters to be included in syncing iCloud drive content
    folders:

      # - jpg
      # - heic
      # - png
```

## Features

### Hard Link Deduplication

When using `all_albums: true`, photos that appear in multiple albums (such as "All Photos", "Videos", and custom albums) would normally be downloaded multiple times, consuming unnecessary storage space.

The `use_hardlinks` feature solves this by:

- **Storage Savings**: Creates hard links instead of duplicate files, potentially saving 50-75% of storage space
- **Smart Processing**: Syncs "All Photos" album first as the reference source
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to normal download if hard link creation fails
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on filesystems that support hard links (Linux, macOS, Windows NTFS)

**Example Configuration:**
```yaml
photos:
  all_albums: true
  use_hardlinks: true  # Enable hard link deduplication
```

**Storage Impact Example:**
- **Without hard links**: Same photo in 3 albums = 3 separate files (3Ã— storage usage)
- **With hard links**: Same photo in 3 albums = 1 file + 2 hard links (1Ã— storage usage)

**_Note: On every sync, this client iterates all the files. Depending on number of files in your iCloud (drive + photos), syncing can take longer._**

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Downloads
This client supports parallel downloads to significantly improve sync performance, especially for users with large amounts of data. The parallel download feature uses multiple threads to download files simultaneously.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic thread scaling**: By default, uses the number of CPU cores (up to 8 threads)
- **Configurable**: Set custom thread count or use "auto" via `max_threads` configuration
- **IO-optimized**: Designed for IO-heavy operations typical in file downloads
- **Thread-safe**: All file operations are protected with locks to ensure data integrity

**Configuration Options:**
- `max_threads: auto` - Automatic scaling based on CPU cores (default)
- `max_threads: 4` - Use 4 parallel download threads
- `max_threads: 1` - Disable parallel downloads (sequential mode)
- Omit the setting to use automatic scaling

**Performance Impact:**
- **Large file collections**: Can reduce sync time from hours to minutes
- **Small file collections**: Minimal impact due to overhead
- **Network-bound**: Most effective on fast internet connections
- **Disk-bound**: Benefits systems with fast storage (SSDs)

## Setup Guides

### UGREEN NAS Setup

This guide helps you set up iCloud sync on a UGREEN NAS system using Docker.

#### Prerequisites
- UGREEN NAS with Docker support
- Docker App installed on your UGREEN NAS
- iCloud account credentials

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Create folder structure in your UGREEN userspace**
   
   Create the following directory structure in your UGREEN user directory:
   ```
   /Cloud-Drives/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Google-Drive
   â”œâ”€â”€ iCloud
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Data
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Config
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.yaml (see step 2)
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ keyring
   â””â”€â”€ OneDrive
   ```

2. **Create config file**
   - Copy the sample configuration from this README
   - Make your adjustments to the `config.yaml` 
   - Place it into the `Config` folder you created above

3. **Create Project in UGREEN Docker App**
   - Open the UGREEN Docker App
   - Name: `icloud-<icloud_username>` (replace `<icloud_username>` with your actual username)
   - Use the following Docker Compose configuration:

   ```yaml
   services:
     icloud-<icloud_username>:
       image: mandarons/icloud-drive
       environment:
         - PUID=<shown above the compose editor>
         - PGID=<shown above the compose editor>
         - ENV_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/config/config.yaml
       container_name: icloud-<icloud_username>
       restart: unless-stopped
       volumes:
         - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
         - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
         - /home/<ugreen_username>/Cloud-Drives/iCloud/Data:/icloud
         - /home/<ugreen_username>/Cloud-Drives/iCloud/Config:/config
         - /home/<ugreen_username>/Cloud-Drives/iCloud/keyring:/home/abc/.local # Optional: Persist keyring for credentials (no password re-entry on container recreation)
   ```
   
   Replace `<ugreen_username>` with your UGREEN system username.

4. **Build and start the container**
   - Save the Docker Compose configuration
   - Build and start the container using the Docker App

5. **Log into your Apple Account**
   - In the UGREEN Docker App, switch to "Containers"
   - Click on your container name `icloud-<icloud_username>`
   - Switch to the "Terminal" tab
   - Click on "Add"
   - Input the command `bin/sh`
   - Run the icloud command:
     ```bash
     su-exec abc icloud --username=<icloud_username> --session-directory=/config/session_data
     ```
   - Follow the authentication prompts to complete 2FA if required

6. **Restart the container**
   - Restart the container from the Docker App to ensure everything is working correctly

#### Multiple Account Setup

To set up multiple iCloud accounts, repeat these steps for each UGREEN user and Apple account combination. Each account should have its own separate folder structure and Docker container.

#### Notes
- This setup provides an iCloud backup solution on UGREEN NAS until official support is available in the UGREEN Cloud Drives App
- The same approach can be adapted for other cloud services like Google Drive and OneDrive
- Make sure to use unique container names for each iCloud account to avoid conflicts
